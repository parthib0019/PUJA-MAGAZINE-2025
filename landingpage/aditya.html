    <p>Imagine that you are going home tired, exhausted and disappointed after a long stay in college with the burdens of assignments, projects and vacation homework in the Mahashasti evening. But unknowingly you enter a different realm, where the stars have come down on earth. Wait they are not stars, they are light chains hanging from darkness. Your sorrow changes to merry. After a few steps you hear those evergreen songs of Manna Dey, Hemanta Mukhopadhyay, Lataji, Kishore Kumar; too far yet too audible. You are being pulled by your childhood days, when exactly these songs were played on binge. You walk more, the lights become more powerful and influential, songs become more louder. You start to vibe with them. Scenes of children with fireworks and boasting about their new clothes enthrals your memories, heart and mind. Suddenly the entire environment fills with sacred smoke of frankincense, flowers and other unknown yet nostalgic smells.</p>
    <p>And finally you meet your old friends. You just shed of all the negetivies and start to chat, dance and do all stupid things which are not so to you. What! Feeling thrilled? Just wait for a few days, the days are coming soon. Anticipation will pay off.</p>
